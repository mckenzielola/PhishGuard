    <h2>What to look out for in Emails?</h2>
    <p><b>1. Check if the sender is using a public domain.</b></p>
          Most companies will use their own domain (the portion of the email after @).
          So if an email is supposedly sent from an organization but they use a public
          domain such as @gmail.com, @outlook.com, @yahoo.com, etc., instead of their
          own domain, then it is likely not a legitimate email.
    <p><b>2. Check the sender’s email address for any typos or misspellings.</b></p>
          Scammers will often use email addresses that appear to look very similar
          to those of known companies and entities. User’s should carefully check
          the sender’s email address for any subtle typos or misspellings, as that
          is a tell-tale sign that the email is a phishing attempt.
    <p><b>3. Check the Reply-To email address.</b></p>
          In some cases, the sender’s email address itself may look legitimate, but
          that email address may not match the Reply-To email address. Always check
          for inconsistencies between the sender’s email address and the Reply-To address.
    <p><b>4. Check the Return-Path email address.</b></p>
          Inconsistencies between the sender’s email address and the Return-Path email
          address is also another sign to look out for to avoid phishing attempts.
          The Return-Path of an email is a hidden header which informs email servers where
          to send any error messages or "bounces" back to the original sender.<br>
          To check the Return-Path for an email in Gmail, click on the 3 dots on the
          top right corner of the email message, and click on “Show Original”, and the
          “Return-Path” can be found on that page.
    <p><b>5. If a link in an email looks suspicious, copy the link and see if it appears
          in any online phishing databases such as <a href="https://phishtank.org/">PhishTank</a>
          or the the <a href="https://github.com/mitchellkrogza/Phishing.Database?tab=readme-ov-file">Phishing
          Database</a> GitHub repository.</b></p>
          PhishTank is a site that allows users to verify suspicious links, and add suspected
          phishing sites to the "tank" to expand their database.
    <p><b>6. Beware of emails that invoke a sense of urgency.</b></p>
          Many phishing emails will scare the receiver by invoking a sense of urgency or
          time-sensitivity in the email itself. Scammers then take advantage of the
          receiver’s sense of panic in these scenarios and expect them to click on provided
          links or attachments, which could potentially contain malicious code, without a
          second thought. When in doubt, do not download attachments provided through email.
    <p><b>7. Beware of emails that contain confidential data requests.</b></p>
          If an email is supposedly sent by an organization and contains a request for
          sensitive information or credentials and links to a site to enter or update said
          information, avoid clicking the link in the email, and instead manually search up
          the organization’s official website and log-in there. This is also a situation
          where PhishTank could come in handy.
